- name: Distributed Semantic Analytics
  description: The research group develops scalable analytics algorithms based on Apache Spark and Apache Flink for analysing large scale datasets by distributing the computational tasks in memory.

- name: Semantic Question Answering
  description: The use of Semantic Web technologies led to an increasing number of structured data published on the Web. Despite the advances on question answering systems retrieving the desired information from structured sources is still a substantial challenge.

- name: Structured Machine Learning
  description: The group focuses on combining Semantic Web and supervised Machine Learning technologies. The goal is to improve both quality and quantity of available knowledge by extracting, analysing, enriching and linking existing data.

- name: Deep Learning
  description: Deep learning models consist of multiple non-linear processing layers which allow for the hierarchical extraction of more and more abstract characteristics of the data and the discovery of the intricate structure in large data sets by building distributed representations.

- name: Geospatial analysis
  description: Geospatial analysis is the gathering, display, and manipulation of imagery, GPS, satellite photography and historical data, described explicitly in terms of geographic coordinates or implicitly, in terms of a street address, postal code, or forest stand identifier as they are applied to geographic models.

- name: Software Engineering for Data Science
  description: The group researches on how data and software engineering methods can be aligned and how those two closely related areas can benefit from each other.
